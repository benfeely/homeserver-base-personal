# AI Infrastructure Setup

This document outlines the AI infrastructure I'm building as part of my homeserver implementation, focusing on local AI model hosting and workflow automation.

## Overview

My AI infrastructure is designed to provide privacy-focused AI assistance for work-related tasks while complying with Microsoft's security requirements. By hosting models locally, I maintain control over data and can customize the workflow for my specific needs.

## Key Components

### Hardware Infrastructure

| Component | Specifications | Role |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| Mac Studio M3 Ultra | 512GB RAM, Apple Silicon | Primary AI model host, daily driver workstation |
| RTX 4090 Workstation | 24GB VRAM, high-end CPU | GPU acceleration for AI tasks requiring CUDA/tensor operations |
| Dell PowerEdge T40 | 64GB RAM, Xeon CPU | Kubernetes host for supporting services |

### Network Configuration

These systems are placed on the Infrastructure subnet (10.10.12.0/24) with static IP assignments:

- Mac Studio: 10.10.12.5 (studio.home.banjonet.com)
- RTX 4090 Workstation: 10.10.12.6 (gpu.home.banjonet.com)
- Proxmox Host: 10.10.12.1 (proxmox.home.banjonet.com)

## AI Workflow Architecture

### Data Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Source Systems**
   - Microsoft Teams (message exports as JSON)
   - Email clients
   - Calendar systems
   - Work documents

2. **Data Processing**
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Metadata extraction
   - Privacy filtering

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - Vector database for efficient retrieval
   - Document storage
   - Versioning and history

### AI Processing Components

1. **LLM Hosting**
   - Large language models running on Mac Studio (leveraging 512GB RAM)
   - Performance-critical operations offloaded to RTX 4090 workstation
   - Model coordination and API layer

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Context enrichment from knowledge base
   - Work-specific context incorporation
   - Semantic search capabilities

3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Workflow management
   - Task prioritization
   - System health monitoring

## Implementation Notes

### Docker Container Structure

The AI system is implemented as a set of Docker containers running on the Mac Studio, with specific GPU-intensive operations offloaded to the RTX 4090 workstation:

- Vector database (e.g., Qdrant, Milvus)
- LLM serving containers
- API gateway
- Data processing pipeline
- Web interface

### Security Considerations

- All data remains local to comply with Microsoft security requirements
- Network isolation for AI systems
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Authentication for API access

### Future Enhancements

- Integration with Kubernetes cluster for better orchestration
- Automated model updating and fine-tuning
- Additional specialized models for specific work domains
- Integration with more data sources
